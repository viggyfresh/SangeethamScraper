SangeethamScraper
=====================

I download, so you don't have to...


Usage:
    1. Install this Chrome extension on your computer.
    2. Navigate to any Sangeethapriya/Sangeethamshare concert listing page.
    3. To the far right of the address bar, an icon will appear. Click it.
    4. The popup extension that appears has a listing of all music files the 
       scraper could read from the current page, as well as one-click download 
       buttons (in red) for each of said files.
    5. Additionally, there are a series of batch download buttons (in green)
       over the top of the track listing table. Clicking on one of them will
       spawn a batch download of up to 5 tracks at time.

Known Limitations:
    1. Chrome only lets you download from up to 5 URLs for a single server
       at a time, hence the need for multiple batch download buttons.
    2. This only works on the Sangeethapriya/Sangeethamshare main sites; if you
       are hanging out at one of the mirror sites, you are short on luck.
    3. If you click away from the extension screen while it is queueing up 
       downloads (i.e. close the extension popup), then any downloads that 
       haven't already been started will not start.
    4. Occasionally hiccups and tries to download the same file twice. Either
       download the missing file manually, or restart your browser.
    5. Obviously only works in Chrome...
